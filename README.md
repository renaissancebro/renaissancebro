Iâ€™m Josh Freeman, I like looking at systems, system design, and relating them.

Over the past few months, Iâ€™ve been creating tools and frameworks that:
	â€¢	Help agents model human-like uncertainty and emotion
	â€¢	Turn AI into modular, testable systems
	â€¢	Scaffold autonomous workflows that scale

Iâ€™m driven by a belief that:

Powerful AI without emotional modeling is blind to what it means to be human.
